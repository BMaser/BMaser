- ðŸ”­ Currently, I am a member of the “WaveLab”, working on computer vision projects in the field of biometrics. Particularly, Finger vein classification using a deep-learning and classical approach. I have worked on many biometric projects. As a result, I have contributed to publishing five papers. Apart from research projects and publishing, I have consistently been committed to developing my skill in applied deep learning and machine learning (let say Machine vision). I cordially keen to work and learn new things in computer vision (CV) and machine learning.

You may see, the list of CV/ML projects that I did in my profile. More information including my resume can be seen on my Linkedin profile as well as my personal homepage at https://bmaser.github.io/

Recently, I worked on a new project to discriminate and identify different sensors based on a deep learning approach. In addition, I did research in the computer vision field that I designed and implemented a solution to detect the image origin of a given finger vein image using statistical methods with a machine learning approach.
