- I am currently a member of The Multimedia Signal Processing and Security Lab (WaveLab), where I research and develop computer vision applications in the field of image forensics, using a deep-learning and classical approach. I've worked on several Image Forensics projects; As a result, I was able to contribute to seven scientific articles. Besides academic research, I've actively worked to develop my advanced deep learning and machine learning skills.

I am eager to work in computer vision and machine learning projects to develop new skills. In my profile, you can see a list of ML projects that I completed. My LinkedIn profile contains additional material, including my CV. My personal homepage is at https://bmaser.github.io/
