After completing my master's program in Computer Science, I worked for about five years as a product manager, system analyst, and web programmer. Due to these experiences, I gained a good understanding of the entire software product's life cycle as a software engineer.

I have concentrated on learning and researching Computer Vision and Machine Learning for the last five years, contributing to a few research projects. As a result, my colleagues and I published seven research papers.   

My research projects focused on:
    
1.	Residual-based texture classification using classical Machine Learning. 
2.	Classification of texture images based on their unique image statistical properties using Classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches.
3.	Effect of media compression on texture classification. 
    
I got good experience using modern Machine Learning methods, and classical computer vision approaches to solve challenging problems in computer vision. Also, I gained good confidence in using Python, Keras 2.X, Tensorflow 2, OpenCV-python, Scikit-learn, Scikit-image.
Apart from skills and knowledge, I am cordially enthusiastic to devote my professional career where I can be involved in solutions that combine modern machine learning approaches with Computer Vision systems.
